<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Fullstack developer</span> | Outlandish<br>
I am currently working on an app for youth homeless charity, <a href="https://centrepoint.org.uk">Centrepoint</a>. The purpose is to make it easier for those formerly homeless to get access to support by making their data available to them electronically. Identification of those requesting data is a significant hurdle, so the app integrates a digital identity platform called <a href="https://www.yoti.com/developers/">Yoti</a>. The data comes from Centrepoint's CRM, which is a homelesss-specific version of Salesforce, called In-Form. The app queries a sandbox version of Centrepoint's instance of In-Form, using the Salesforce API. This was a joint project with Founders & Coders, Yoti, Centrepoint and <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a>.</p>
